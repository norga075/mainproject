			<p class="YogaDescription">Throughout any given day, there can be multiple events that prompt anxious thoughts and stressed behavior. These events can set off a physical response such as: increased heart rate, restlessness, or not being able to make direct eye contact. To combat these sudden anxious thoughts and seemingly uncontrollable bodily responses long-term, one should resort to implementing the practice of yoga into their daily routine.</p>
