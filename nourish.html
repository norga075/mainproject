	<div class="breakfast">Breakfast
		<p class="breakfastdescription">Try making a smoothie bowl for breakfast in the morning. Eating fruit first thing in the morning has the same amount if not more energy to jumpstart your day than coffee. Blend up your favorite frozen fruit, adding a splash of almond milk and a scoop of protein powder as well. Pour into a bowl and top with cut up fruit, granola, seeds and coconut flakes. Enjoy!</p>

	<div class="lunch">Lunch
		<p class="lunchdescription">For a satisfying mid-day meal, make yourself a salad niçoise. The name sounds fancier than it really is. Start by broiling your salmon in the oven until cooked to your liking. Next, slice the lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, and roasted red pepper. Lastly, assemble everything into a bowl and top with a lemon vinaigrette. Enjoy!</p>

	<div class="dinner">Dinner
		<p class="dinnerdescription">By the time dinner rolls around, you're probably craving something a little more substantial. Making your very own homemade ramen bowl is a fun way to incorporate vegetables. Start by cooking your noodles. Next, prep your veggies by shaving a few carrots, slice some scallions, chop and sauté some mushrooms, and wash the bok choy leaves. Finally, assemble it all together in a big bowl. Enjoy!</p>
